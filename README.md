<h3>Description</h3>
Flowmodoro - a reverse pomodoro timer, which instead of counting down the timer and having a short/long break, we count up the timer and divide the total time by 5 to be counted as the break time. 

<h3>Benefits of Flowmodoro vs Pomodoro</h3>
- Beginners might not be able to focus for a full 25 minutes. Flowmodoro allows flexibility.<br>
- The longer you focus the longer the break time - This can be an incentive to stay focus.<br>
- Users can keep track of how long they can focus for and try to improve it every round.

<h3>Future plans</h3>
- To allow user to keep track of their focus timings. <br>
- To implement a graph chart to allow user to view how has their focus improve/deprove over time<br>
- Allow user to save data tied to their login
